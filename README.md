NYCDSA Fall 2021 - Python Project

The premise for this project was gathering data to valuate classic cars. Free online car valuation tools exist - but only for modern cars.

The stakeholders in this project are classic car sellers, insurance companies, and the supposed owner of such an online tool.

I scraped data on more than 12,000 cars. Features included: when it was sold, where it was sold, how much it was sold for, whether it was sold
or not, and the year, make and model. 

My first test was valuating a specific luxury sports car, a 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 Touring, a mouthful. 

Overall I had about 16 observations of this car being sold which meant my data was quite sparse. Creating a boxplot of this data, there was a range of more than $200K USD. 

This was expected, as old cars have a great variation in condition which affects their value.

Further tests included more affordable cars such as an Austin Mini Cooper. 

After running analysis on more cars I concluded that for this tool to be accurate it would need much more data. Further, I would need to implement the code
into an app (like Shiny) to setup a full user side expirience. Overall, I think the accurate valuation of classic cars is possible but would take much more data
and many more data features to distinguish a cars value.
